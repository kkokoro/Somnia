## Overview
In **Somnia**, you play as a Spirit Guide tasked with restoring balance to interconnected dream realms. Each realm represents a spirit’s emotional state and is shaped by real-world trauma and emotions. Players explore these dreamscapes, solve emotion-themed puzzles, confront shadow manifestations of trauma, and recover Lucid Fragments—pieces of their own lost memories.  

A central Hub connects all realms, expanding as spirits are healed and unlocking new abilities, spells, and areas. Along the way, the player gradually uncovers the true story of who they were before becoming a Spirit Guide.

Future updates include Japanese translations, expanding accessibility for international players.
